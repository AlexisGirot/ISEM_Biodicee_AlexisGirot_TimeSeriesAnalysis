# Time series analysis

This package aims at simplying the analysis of ecological time series, in particular when looking for resilience indicators.

## Classification

This package allows to classify time series in different classes : constant, linear, quadratic, abrupt. This is based on the work of [Pelissie et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110429) and I am using [their code](https://github.com/matpelissie/abrupt_shifts_ecological_timeseries_classification) for the classification of time series.
